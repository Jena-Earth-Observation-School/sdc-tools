# About

`sdc-tools` is a collection of tools for working with the SALDi Data Cube (SDC), which 
is hosted on the Draco HPC cluster at the University of Jena and contains various Earth 
Observation data sets for the six study areas of the [SALDi project](https://www.saldi.uni-jena.de/en).

The following pages provide information on how to install and use the `sdc-tools` 
package, as well as several introductory tutorials tailored to our students of the M.Sc. 
Geoinformatics program at the University of Jena. 

Please note:
- Access to the SDC is restricted to employees and students affiliated with the 
Department for Earth Observation of the University of Jena, however, some tools and 
tutorials might still be useful for others who are working with similar data sets.
- If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/Jena-Earth-Observation-School/sdc-tools/issues),
post in the [discussions](https://github.com/Jena-Earth-Observation-School/sdc-tools/discussions) 
or reach out directly to me via the email provided [here](https://github.com/maawoo).

_The SDC illustrations have been created by P. Kluter (2020) of the Remote Sensing 
department at the University of Würzburg for the [project page](https://eo2cube.org/projects/saldi) 
of the first SALDi Data Cube implementation. Thanks for letting us use them here as 
well!_
